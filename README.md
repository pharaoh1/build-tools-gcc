# GCC toolchain build script

This is a script to build GCC toolchains targeting arm and arm64 devices
(primarily Android devices).


## Using the script

To build a toolchain, you will need to the
following:

+ A Linux distribution (the script has been tested on Ubuntu 17.04 and Arch Linux)
+ A decent processor and RAM (i5 and 8GB of RAM or more is preferred)
+ Core developer packages
    + For Arch: the base-devel package should be enough
    + For Ubuntu: ```sudo apt-get install flex bison ncurses-dev texinfo gcc gperf patch libtool automake g++ libncurses5-dev gawk subversion expat libexpat1-dev python-all-dev binutils-dev libgcc1:i386 bc libcloog-isl-dev libcap-dev autoconf libgmp-dev build-essential gcc-multilib g++-multilib pkg-config libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev```

Once you have set up your environment, run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nathanchance/build-tools-gcc
cd build-tools-gcc
./build -h
```

The printout will show you how to run the script. A fuller explananation of the
parameters is below


## Parameters

NOTE: Multiple parameters can and will almost always be used. See examples below.

+ ```-a | --arm:``` This allows the user to build an arm toolchain, instead of an arm64 toolchain.
+ ```-b | --build:``` Build the toolchain. This parameter MUST be added for the toolchain to build if you add any parameters. Running just ```./build``` will use this.
+ ```-c | --clean:``` Clean up from a previous build. Do this after the first download after every build.
+ ```-d | --download:``` Downloads the necessary components to compile. This MUST be added before building for the first time.
+ ```-h | --help:``` Run the help menu then exits. Use this whenever you forget how to run the script.
+ ```-l | --linaro:``` Builds a Linaro toolchain from the latest release branch, instead of the standard GNU source
+ ```-nt | --no-tmpfs:``` Do not mount the build directories on tmpfs (use this if you don't have a lot of RAM)
+ ```-p | --package:``` Compress toolchain after building; specify either gz or xz. Example ```-p gz```
+ ```-u | --update:``` Updates the git repos that were downloaded. Recommended before any build.
+ ```-v | --version:``` Specify which GCC version to build (4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 [GNU only]). Example: ```-v 7```

Example commands:

```bash
# Build a Linaro toolchain for the first time
# Download components, checkout Linaro, then build
./build -d -l -b

# Build a GNU toolchain after a few compilations
# Update sources, clean previous compilation, then build
./build -u -c -b
```

If you want to switch between GNU and Linaro builds, ALWAYS run update so that
it checks out the proper branch.
The printout will show you how to run the script.

Example commands:

# Build a Linaro 7.x toolchain for x86_64
./build -a x86_64 -s linaro -v 7

# Build a Linaro 7.x toolchain for arm64
./build -a arm64 -s linaro -v 7

# Build a GNU 5.x toolchain for arm
./build -a arm -s gnu -v 5

## After compilation

Once it is done building, you will have a folder with the compiled toolchain as well as either a tar.xz or tar.gz file (depending on if you passed -p or not).

If the toolchains are compressed, move them into your directory of choice and run the following commands:

For xz compression:

```bash
tar -xvf <toolchain_name>.tar.xz --strip-components=1
```

For gz compression:

```bash
tar -xvzf <toolchain_name>.tar.gz --strip-components=1
```

After that, point your cross compiler to the proper file and compile! This is
an easy shortcut for kernels (when run in the directory you extracted the
toolchain in):

```bash
# for arm64
export CROSS_COMPILE=$(pwd)/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-

# for arm
export CROSS_COMPILE=$(pwd)/bin/arm-linux-gnueabi-
```


## Pull requests/issues

If you have any issues with this script, feel free to open an issue!

Pull requests are more than welcome as well. However, I will only
accept a particular coding style:

+ All variables are uppercased and use curly braces: ```${VARIABLE}``` instead of ```$variable```
+ Four spaces for indents
+ All conditions must be one line to start: ```if [[ conditions ]]; then```
+ Double brackets and single equal sign for string comparisons in if blocks: ```if [[ ${VARIABLE} = "yes" ]]; then```
